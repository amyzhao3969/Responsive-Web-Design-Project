                            <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                                It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but 
                                effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant 
                                syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, 
                                make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application 
                                development in many areas on most platforms.</p>

                            <p>
                                Python is used successfully in thousands of real-world business applications around the world, including many large and mission critical systems. Here's where':
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                    </div>

                    <div id="main-doc-inner">
                        <section id="Python-Syntax" class="main-section">
                            <header class="section_header">
                                <h2>Python Syntax</h2>
                            </header>
                            <p>Syntax refers to the structure of the language 
                                (i.e., what constitutes a correctly-formed program).</p>
                            <h3>Hello World</h3>
                            <p>Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
                            <code>
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!         
                            </code>
                            <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, 
                                and running it in the Command Line:</p>
                            <code>
C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
                            </code>

                            <h3>Python Variables</h3>
                            <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:</p>
                            <code>
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
                            </code>

                            <h3>Python Indentation</h3>
                            <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
                                Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is 
                                for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
                                Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                            <code>
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
                            </code>
                        </section>
                    </div>

                    <div id="main-doc-inner">
                        <section id="Control-Flow-Tools" class="main-section">
                            <header class="section_header">
                                <h2>Control Flow Tools</h2>
                            </header>
                            <p>A program’s control flow is the order in which the program’s code executes. The 
                                control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, 
                                and function calls. </p>
                            <h3>The If Statement</h3>
                            <p>Often, you need to execute some statements only if some condition holds, or 
                                choose statements to execute depending on several mutually exclusive conditions. 
                                The Python compound statement if, which uses if, elif, and else clauses, lets you 
                                conditionally execute blocks of statements. Here’s a typical if statement:
                            </p>
                            <code>
if x < 0:
    print "x is negative"
elif x % 2:
    print "x is positive and odd"
else:
    print "x is even and non-negative"
                            </code>

                            <h3>The While Statement</h3>
                            <p>The while statement in Python supports repeated execution of a statement or block 
                                of statements that is controlled by a conditional expression. Here’s a typical while 
                                statement:
                            </p>
                            <code>
count = 0
while x > 0:
    x = x // 2            # truncating division
    count += 1
print "The approximate log2 is", count
                            </code>

                            <h3>The For Statement</h3>
                            <p>The for statement in Python supports repeated execution of a statement or block of 
                                statements that is controlled by an iterable expression. Here’s a typical for statement:
                            </p>
                            <code>
for letter in "ciao":
print "give me a", letter, "..."
                            </code>

                            <h3>Iterators</h3>
                            <p>An iterator is any object i such that you can call i .next( ) without any arguments. i .next( ) 
                                returns the next item of iterator i, or, when iterator i has no more items, raises a 
                                StopIteration exception.
                            </p>
                            <code>
for i in xrange(n):
statement(s)
                            </code>

                                <h2>Data Structures</h2>
                            </header>
                            <p>Data structures are the fundamental constructs around which you build your programs. 
                                Each data structure provides a particular way of organizing data so it can be 
                                accessed efficiently, depending on your use case. Python ships with an extensive 
                                set of data structures in its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">standard library</a>.</p>
                            <h3>Dictionaries, Maps, and Hash Tables</h3>
                            <p>In Python, dictionaries (or dicts for short) are a central data structure. Dicts store an arbitrary number of 
                                objects, each identified by a unique dictionary key.</p>
                            <p>Dictionaries are also often called maps, hashmaps, lookup tables, or associative arrays. They allow for the 
                                efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of any object associated with a given key.</p>
                            <p>Here is a small example using a dictionary:</p>
                            <code>
>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
>>> tel['guido'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127}
>>> tel['jack']
4098
>>> del tel['sape']
>>> tel['irv'] = 4127
>>> tel
{'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}
>>> list(tel)
['jack', 'guido', 'irv']
>>> sorted(tel)
['guido', 'irv', 'jack']
>>> 'guido' in tel
True
>>> 'jack' not in tel
False
                            </code>

                            <h3>Lists</h3>
                            <p>Python lists can hold arbitrary elements—everything is an object in Python, including 
                                functions. Therefore, you can mix and match different kinds of data types and store 
                                them all in a single list.
                            </p>
                            <code>
>>> arr = ["one", "two", "three"]
>>> arr[0]
'one'

>>> # Lists have a nice repr:
>>> arr
['one', 'two', 'three']
                            </code>
